# Social Network
CSCI 62 class project. A basic social network built with C++ and QT. Built throughout the quarter (Jan 2025 - March 2025).

- Much of the base design was prescribed by the course curriculum.
- Implementation was done mainly by myself, with some collaboration on certain methods.
- Polls fully designed and implemented by myself as final project.
- UI created using QT Creator (WYSIWYG editor and C++).
